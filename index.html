      <p class='description' align="left"> Hey, my name is Florian Godfrey Link and I'm from Portland, Oregon. I'm currently a senior at the University of
          Puget Sound, majoring in computer science with a minor in economics. I initially planned on studying physics, but 
          after taking some classes it turned out that I didn't enjoy it as much as I was hoping I would. In the Spring of 
          my sophomore year, I thought CS 161 might be interesting, so I took it and ended up really liking it, so much so 
          that I eventually switched my major to CS. I think the thing I like most about it is the problem solving aspect and 
          the fact that there are lots of ways to solve the same problem. Coding forces you to think differently and creatively 
          in order to achieve your goal and I think that is a great thing.</p>

      <p class='description' align="left"> As well as coding, I enjoy playing basketball/soccer, doing photography, listening to music, camping, hiking, 
          and anything else outdoors. In high school I played JV soccer and basketball during my freshman and sophomore 
          as well as club soccer through my senior year. I really like just staying active in general and I think it's 
          a great way to stay healthy and have fun at the same time. Here at UPS, I'm a part of the intramural sports
          staff, and I play IM basketball as well. I'm also involved with greek life, as a member of the Sigma Chi 
          Fraternity. Overall I have really enjoyed my time so far here at Puget Sound, and I'm looking forward to having
          a great senior year as I work on becoming a better programmer, with the goal of hopefully beginning a career
          in computer science.
