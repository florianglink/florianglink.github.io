      <h1>Florian Godfrey Link's GitHub Homepage</h1>
      <p>Hey, my name is Florian and I'm from Portland, Oregon. I'm currently a senior at the University of Puget Sound, 
        majoring in computer science with a minor in Economics. I initially planned on studying physics, but after taking
        some classes it turned out that I didn't enjoy it as much as I was hoping I would. In the Spring of my sophomore
        year, I thought CS 161 might be interesting, so I took it and ended up really enjoying it, so much so that I 
        eventually switched my major to CS. I think the thing I like most about it is the problem solving aspect and the 
        fact that there are lots of ways to solve the same problem. Coding forces you to think differently and creatively 
        in order to achieve your goal and I think that is a great thing.   </p>
